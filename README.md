# CPU Emulator
 The project involved designing an emulation of a central processing unit (CPU) with a 16-bit architecture and an instruction set. The CPU had the ability to fetch and decode instructions, manipulate memory, stack, and registers, and perform basic arithmetic and logic operations.  The project included the development of an assembler to compile assembly code into machine code, and an emulator to execute the machine code which was then displayed through virtual memory.  The implementation was done in Python3 using Visual Studio Code and required defining an instruction set, designing an assembler, and developing a CPU emulator with control logic, a decoder, and a memory display function.The project involved designing an emulation of a central processing unit (CPU) with a 16-bit architecture and an instruction set.
